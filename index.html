                <p>how many times have you wanted to improve your English but didn't succed? how many times have you
                    thought "i wish i could take part in this conversation but they talk too fast? i'm sure many of you
                    have had this struggle. i know, i too have had it for many years" </p>
                <p>that's why i've developed what i call the <span>stream method</span>. a method where you train your
                    brain to get used to a new language the same way babies learn their mother language. babies do not
                    read dictionaries, nor do they go to special classes. Babies learn a language by getting exposed to
                    it all trhe fucking time. </p>
                <p>In this sense, podcasts are far better than any other form of media. they have no background noise /
                    music / or any form of distraction. moreover, it is very easy to change the speed of playback as
                    well as skip back if you didn't understand something</p>
                <p>that's why iv'e handpicked for you a list of easy to listen to podcasts where the hosts speak in an
                    easy to understand level and at an average speed. let's get going!</p>
